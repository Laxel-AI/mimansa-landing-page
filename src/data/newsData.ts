        <p>In a landmark decision yesterday, the Supreme Court of India has significantly reshaped the data privacy landscape with implications for both domestic and international businesses operating in India.</p>
        
        <p>The ruling in <em>Data Privacy Commission v. TechGiant India Ltd.</em> clarifies the extent of constitutional privacy protections in the commercial context and establishes new standards for consent and data minimization that go beyond previous interpretations.</p>
        
        <p>Key points from the ruling include:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Enhanced transparency requirements for data collection practices</li>
          <li>Stricter standards for establishing valid user consent</li>
          <li>New limitations on secondary data usage and processing</li>
          <li>Expanded right to erasure guidelines</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The decision creates immediate compliance obligations for technology companies, particularly those in e-commerce, social media, and digital advertising sectors. Companies now have a 90-day window to align their data practices with the new standards or face potential regulatory action.</p>
        
        <p>Mimansa Law's Privacy and Data Security team is available to assist clients in understanding the full implications of this ruling and implementing necessary changes to data governance frameworks and privacy policies.</p>
